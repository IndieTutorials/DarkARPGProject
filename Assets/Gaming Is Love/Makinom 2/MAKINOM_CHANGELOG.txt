Changes:
- UI Boxes: Some input/tab settings have been moved from the 'UI Box' component to the UI box setup in 'UI > UI Boxes' in the Makinom editor. 'Auto Select First Input', 'Loop', 'Select First', 'Unfocused Selection' and 'Unfocused Highlight' are now part of the 'Controls' settings in 'UI > UI Boxes' (both default in the general settings and the individual UI box overrides). You have to redo your setup if you use any of these.
- Variables: Object ID: The 'Object ID' definition when accessing variables (e.g. 'Change Variables' node or variable conditions) is now a string value selection field. E.g. allows using the current scene name as object ID.
- Variable Conditions: 'Exists' setting is now by default disabled in newly created conditions. Your old settings are not changed by this.
- Vector 3 Values: 'Gravity 2D' and 'Gravity 3D' have been moved from 'Value' to 'Physics' sub-menu.
- Unity UI Setup: Context Menu: Creating UI boxes, inputs and HUDs using the scene hierarchy context menu will now add 'UI Color Changer' and 'UI Input Color Changer' (for inputs) components.
- Editor Settings: Text Area: 'Preview Height' has been changed to 'Max Preview Height'. The setting now defines the maximum height the text preview (i.e. showing text of a currently not editing text area) will have instead of a fixed height.
- Editor: Highly reduced the time it takes to open the Makinom editor. This comes at the cost of only searching for data assets in Makinom's data path ('Assets/Gaming Is Love/_Data/'), i.e. any individual Makinom data assets outside the data path will not be displayed in the editor. This limitation can only be changed in the source code.
- Editor: Highly reduced the time it takes to save the Makinom project in the editor. Saving will now only save the Makinom assets that where actually changed. The more different settings/assets you change, the longer saving will take. This has no effect on the time it takes to create an (optional) backup.
- Editor: Language Content Definition: The 'Language Content' foldout when defining texts and icons for other languages is now by default closed.
- Editor: Custom Content: The 'Custom Content' you can define for the content information of data (e.g. 'Scene Objects') is now by default closed (foldout).
- Editor: Foldouts: Improved foldout behaviour when opening/closing foldouts with child foldouts. The foldouts should now keep their opened/closed state intact without shifting to other foldouts.
- Editor: Saving: The 'Create Backup' toggle's state will now be remembered between saves.
- Scene Wizard: 'Create Game Object', 'Add Component' and 'Add Machine' now use searchable popup selections to select which game object/component/machine to use. You can extend the available options by deriving from 'SceneWizard_BaseCreateObject', 'SceneWizard_BaseAddComponent' and 'SceneWizard_BaseAddMachine', implementing a static, parameterless function named 'Use' for what happens when it's selected.
- Animations: Mecanim: The 'Animation Clip' duration type will now multiply the clip's duration with the animator's speed to get the actual animation duration.
- Game Settings: Raycast Type: The 'Raycast Type' setting is now used as the global default raycast type. All other raycast type settings now offer a 'Default' option (replacing the separate 'Own Raycast Type' setting), using the default raycast type. All other raycast type settings have been changed to 'Default'.
- HUDs: Tooltip: 'Tooltip Check' settings replace the previous 'Inputs' and 'Scene Object' tooltip settings. Tooltip checks are an extensible system for checking which tooltips to display. When no checks are added, all tooltips can be displayed by the HUD. Please note that previous settings will not be udpated to the new system.
- Schematics: Rigidbody Constraints: You can now add multiple constraints to e.g. freeze X and Y rotation.
- Schematics: Show Dialogue: Choices: 'Variable Conditions' have been replaced by general 'Conditions' in individual 'Choice' settings. Currently supports variable and game state conditions. Previous settings will be updated automatically.
- Schematics: Show Dialogue: Notification: The 'Notification Queue' setting is now a popup selection, allowing to add, replace or queue notifications (instead of only replace and queue as with the previous toggle setting). Previous settings will be updated automatically.
- Schematics: Auto Save Slot Dialogue, Language Dialogue, Value Option Dialogue: Speaker, portrait and audio options have been removed and remodeled to regular title/message content display to make these dialogues useable outside schematics (e.g. for future extensions).
- Schematics: Shake Camera, Shake Object: Intensity values are no longer limited to be between 0 and 1 (but it's still recommended for most use cases). E.g. using orthographic cameras with a large size require higher intensity values for the shaking to be noticable.

Fixes:
- Editor: Popups: Fixed an issue where closing popups by clicking on the popup field again blocked scrolling.
- Editor: Popups: Fixed an issue where popups didn't open to the top side when being too close to the bottom. Issue was related to using different screen size scaling (Unity Editor Preferences).
- Editor: Fixed an issue where copying listed data would use blank content information with only the copy name.
- Variable/Reflection Fields: Fixed issues with variable and reflection fields that automatically selected and overwrote the initially typed letters when opening the selection popup.
- Game Settings: Asset Settings: Asset Source Changes: Fixed an issue where the project-wide asset source changes didn't work correctly.
- Unity UI: Portraits: Fixed an issue where using 'Disable If Empty' didn't disable the game object when showing no portrait.
- Unity UI: Fixed placement issues when using 'Screen Space Camera' canvas.
- Save Games: Fixed an issue where float values in save games could be saved with wrong values.
- Save Games: Saving object variables now allows spaces in variable keys, this previously caused errors. Please note that previous save games will not load their object variables.
- Save Games: Fixed an issue where save file descriptions where not displayed. Will be displayed for new save games created with this version (or newer), as the description with the save game content is part of the save file.
- Input Keys: Unity Input Manager: Fixed an issue where using 'Is Joypad Axis' could lead to continuous input.
- Backups: Backups exceeding the defined number of backups where not deleted.
- Schematics: Load Scene: Using 'Stored' origin didn't load the stored scene.
- Schematics: Actors: Find Object: Fixed an issue where the search wasn't processed if no machine object was available.
- Schematic Nodes: Change Position: Fixed an issue where the radius from 'Radius' components wasn't used in stop distances.
- UI Boxes: Fixed an issue where using typewriter with a text speed of 0 didn't display the full text and stopped at 1 letter.
- UI Boxes: Controls: Fixed an issue where the (optional) scroll axis input wasn't used when inputs where added to the UI box (e.g. dialogue choices).
- Music: Fixed an issue where looping didn't work correctly when playing a stored music.
